## Introduction

The Watson Assistant Dialog Flow Analysis Notebook can help you assess and analyze user journeys and issues related to the dialog flow of ineffective (low quality) conversations based on production logs.  The notebook can help you with questions such as:
- What are the common conversation steps and flows within the assistant 
- Which flows have low task completion rates and high abandonment (ineffective conversations)
- Where along the dialog steps users lose engagement with your assistant
- What are common terms and steps that may lead to abandonment

This notebook extends the [Measure and Analyze notebooks](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook) by providing additional capabilities to assess and analyze effectiveness - focused more on issues related to the dialog flow.  For more details, check out [IBM Watson Assistant Continuous Improvement Best Practices](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook/raw/master/notebook/IBM%20Watson%20Assistant%20Continuous%20Improvement%20Best%20Practices.pdf).
